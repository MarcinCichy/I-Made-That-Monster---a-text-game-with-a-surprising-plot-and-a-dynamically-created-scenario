# I Made That Monster
#
# The text game in Python
# 
## The code includes dynamic class instance creation based on the "description.txt" and "alternative_description.txt" text files.

## Everyone can create their own game scenario by modifying the "description.txt" and "alternative_description.txt" files, according to the given rule:

### ##### LEGEND ####
### ## line 0 - START_CHAPTER_NAME
### ## line 1 - equipment
### ## line 2 - wrong answer/ direction to death
### ## line 3 - good answer/ direction to alive
### ## next lines - lines of room description
### ## penultimate line - item, which you can use in that room (only one :( )
### ## END_CHAPTER_NAME

### The number of rooms is limited only by the invention of the game's creator.
